# üìÖ DkIT Timetable App Alternative

This project is an **alternative timetable application** for students at **Dundalk Institute of Technology (DkIT)**, developed to address common usability and design issues with the current in-house system.

## üí° Project Motivation

As a **2nd Year Software Development student** at DkIT, I created this application over the summer break after experiencing and hearing several complaints about the existing timetable website. The goal was to build a modern, intuitive, and user-friendly alternative.

### Current System Complaints Addressed:

* **Poor UI/UX:** The new application features a streamlined and modern design that is intuitive to navigate.
* **Awkward Layout:** Both list and grid views have been redesigned for better legibility and ease of reading.
* **Repetitive Searching:** The app implements a **saved course** feature so you don't have to find your class every time.
* **Literal Search:** The application's course search is more flexible and forgiving than the current literal-match system.

Initial feedback from classmates has been overwhelmingly positive, suggesting these issues have been successfully resolved.
